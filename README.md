## My WooCommerce Overlapping Banner 

Enables dynamic overlapping banner feature for your WooCommerce products, designed to highlight stock levels and create a sense of urgency.

**Key Features:**

* **Dynamic "Sold Out" Percentage Banner:** Displays a compelling "X% Sold" or "Sold Out!" message directly on product listings.

* **Product-Level Configuration:** Introduces a new "Initial Stock Quantity" field in the product inventory settings, allowing you to define the original stock for accurate percentage calculation.

* **Visual Progress Meter:** Includes a subtle progress bar that visually represents the percentage of stock sold for each product.

* **Flexible Display Locations:** The banner is automatically added to:

  * WooCommerce shop and archive pages (e.g., categories, tags).

  * Individual single product pages (positioned within the product summary).

* **Conditional Styling Support:** Automatically adds a unique CSS class (`is-single-product-banner`) to the banner when displayed on single product pages, enabling distinct styling for different contexts.

* **WooCommerce Dependency:** Ensures the plugin only activates if WooCommerce is installed and active, providing a graceful fallback if not.

**How to Use:**

1. Install and activate the plugin.

2. For each product, navigate to its "Inventory" tab in the product data section.

3. Ensure "Manage stock?" is checked.

4. Enter the "Initial Stock Quantity" to set the baseline for percentage calculation.

5. The banner will dynamically update on your shop, archive, and single product pages as stock changes.
